@article{Ferdous2019,
   abstract = {In recent times, with the advent of blockchain technology, there is an optimism surrounding the concept of self-sovereign identity which is regarded to have an influential effect on how we interact with each other over the Internet in future. There are a few works in the literature which examine different aspects of self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, the existing works are not methodological and comprehensive at all. Moreover, there exist different notions of what the term self-sovereign identity means. To exploit its full potential, it is essential to ensure a common understanding in a formal way. This paper aims to achieve this goal by providing the first-ever formal and rigorous treatment of the concept of self-sovereign identity using a mathematical model. This paper examines the properties that a self-sovereign identity should have and explores the impact of self-sovereign identity over the laws of identity. It also highlights the essential life-cycles of an identity management system and inter-relates how the notion of self-sovereign identity can be applied in these life-cycles. In addition, the paper illustrates several envisioned flows involving a self-sovereign identity leveraging blockchain technology covering different aspects of an identity management system. All in all, this paper presents the first formal and comprehensive step toward an academic investigation of self-sovereign identity.},

   abstract = {Data replication is used in distributed systems to maintain up-to-date copies of shared data across multiple computers in a network. However, despite decades of research, algorithms for achieving consistency in replicated systems are still poorly understood. Indeed, many published algorithms have later been shown to be incorrect, even some that were accompanied by supposed mechanised proofs of correctness. In this work, we focus on the correctness of Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), a class of algorithm that provides strong eventual consistency guarantees for replicated data. We develop a modular and reusable framework in the Isabelle/HOL interactive proof assistant for verifying the correctness of CRDT algorithms. We avoid correctness issues that have dogged previous mechanised proofs in this area by including a network model in our formalisation, and proving that our theorems hold in all possible network behaviours. Our axiomatic network model is a standard abstraction that accurately reflects the behaviour of real-world computer networks. Moreover, we identify an abstract convergence theorem, a property of order relations, which provides a formal definition of strong eventual consistency. We then obtain the first machine-checked correctness theorems for three concrete CRDTs: the Replicated Growable Array, the Observed-Remove Set, and an Increment-Decrement Counter. We find that our framework is highly reusable, developing proofs of correctness for the latter two CRDTs in a few hours and with relatively little CRDT-specific code.},

In fact, the conventional wisdom that publishers benefit too from behaviorally targeted advertising has rarely been scrutinized in academic studies. We investigate how the (un)availability of users' cookies, which affects the ability of advertisers to perform be-havioral targeting, impacts publishers' revenues. We leverage a rich dataset of millions of advertising transactions completed across multiple websites owned by a large media company. We implement an augmented version of the inverse probability weighting, a double-robust estimator that allows us to estimate effects even in the presence of potential confounding. We find that when a user's cookie is available publisher's revenue increases by only about 4%. This corresponds to an average increase of $0.00008 per advertisement. The results contribute to the current debate over online behavioral advertising, and how benefits accrued from tracking and targeting online consumers may be differentially allocated to various stakeholders in the advertising ecosystem.},

Contrary to the traditional waterfall standard, HB aims to give back to publishers control of their ad inventory, increase transparency, fairness and competition among advertisers, resulting in higher ad-slot prices. Although promising, little is known about how this ad protocol works: What are HB's possible implementations, who are the major players, and what is its network and UX overhead? To address these questions, we design and implement HBDetector: a novel methodology to detect HB auctions on a website at real-time. By crawling 35,000 top Alexa websites, we collect and analyze a dataset of 800k auctions. We find that: (i) 14.28% of top websites utilize HB. (ii) Publishers prefer to collaborate with a few Demand Partners who also dominate the waterfall market. (iii) HB latency can be significantly higher (up to 3× in median case) than waterfall.},

However, this process is a “black box”—little is known about the reliability of the digital profiles that are created or of the audience identification provided by buying platforms. In this paper, we investigate using three field tests the accuracy of a variety of demographic and audience-interest segments. We examine the accuracy of more than 90 third-party audiences across 19 data brokers. Audience segments vary greatly in quality and are often inaccurate across leading data brokers. In comparison with random audience selection, the use of black box data profiles, on average, increased identification of a user with a desired single attribute by 0%–77%. Audience identification can be improved, on average, by 123% when combined with optimization software. However, given the high extra costs of targeting solutions and the relative inaccuracy, we find that third-party audiences are often economically unattractive except for higher-priced media placements.},

We focus on the economic value and consequences of protecting and disclosing personal information, and on consumers' understanding and decisions regarding the trade-offs associated with the privacy and the sharing of personal data. We highlight how the economic analysis of privacy evolved over time, as advancements in information technology raised increasingly nuanced and complex issues associated with the protection and sharing of personal information. We find and highlight three themes that connect diverse insights from the literature. First, characterizing a single unifying economic theory of privacy is hard, because privacy issues of economic relevance arise in widely diverse contexts. Second, there are theoretical and empirical situations where the protection of privacy can both enhance, and detract from, individual and societal welfare. Third, in digital economies, consumers' ability to make informed decisions about their privacy is severely hindered, because consumers are often in a position of imperfect or asymmetric information regarding when their data is collected, for what purposes, and with what consequences. We conclude the article by highlighting some of the ongoing issues in the privacy debate of interest to economists.},

Privacy regulation increases the firm's cost of collecting consumer data which makes matching with users more costly. As such, the GDPR has the potential to reduce both the amount of traffic to a website as well as the amount and quality of web outcome data stored for analytics purposes. We examine the impact of the GDPR on European web traffic and E-commerce sales using web analytics data from a diverse set of 1508 firms that use the Adobe Analytics platform. Using a difference-indifferences approach, we show that recorded pageviews and recorded revenues fall by about 10% for EU users after the GDPR's enforcement deadline. The extensive margin drives these changes as a user's average time on site and average page views per visit stay constant.},

This paper focuses on the question: Can we repurpose this language to define schemas for graph databases that are based on the Property Graph model? This question is relevant because there does not exist a commonly adopted approach to define schemas for Property Graphs, and because the form in which GraphQL APIs represent their underlying data sources is very similar to the Property Graph model. To answer the question we propose an approach to adopt the GraphQL SDL for Property Graph schemas. We define this approach formally and show its fundamental properties.},

   abstract = {We study consumer privacy choice in the context of online display advertising, where advertisers track consumers' browsing to improve ad targeting. In 2010, the American ad industry implemented a self-regulation mechanism that overlaid “AdChoices” icons on ads, which consumers could click to opt out of online behavioral advertising. We examine the real-world uptake of AdChoices using transaction data from an ad exchange. Though consumers express strong privacy concerns in surveys, we find that only 0.23% of American ad impressions arise from users who opted out of online behavioral advertising. We also find that opt-out user ads fetch 59.2% less revenue on the exchange than do comparable ads for users who allow behavioral targeting. These findings are broadly consistent with evidence from the European Union and Canada, where industry subsequently implemented the AdChoices program. We calculate an upper bound for the industry's value of the average opt-out user's browsing information to be $8 per capita annually in the US. We find that opt-out users tend to be more technologically sophisticated, though opt-out rates are higher in American states with lower income. These results inform the privacy policy discussion by illuminating the real-world consequences of an opt-out privacy mechanism.},

   abstract = {To measure the effects of advertising, marketers must know how consumers would behave had they not seen the ads. The authors develop a methodology they call "ghost ads," which facilitates this comparison by identifying the control group counterparts of the exposed consumers in a randomized experiment. The authors show that, relative to public service announcement and intent-to-treat A/B tests, ghost ads can reduce the cost of experimentation, improve measurement precision, deliver the relevant strategic baseline, and work with modem ad platforms that optimize ad delivery in real time. The authors also describe a variant, "predicted ghost ad" methodology, which is compatible with online display advertising platforms; their implementation records more than 100 million predicted ghost ads per day. The authors demonstrate the methodology with an online retailer's display retargeting campaign. They show novel evidence that retargeting can work: the ads lifted website visits by 17.2% and purchases by 10.5%. Compared with intent-to-treat and public service announcement experiments, advertisers can measure ad lift just as precisely while spending at least an order of magnitude less.},

   abstract = {Data brokers often use online browsing records to create digital consumer profiles they sell to marketers as pre-defined audiences. However, this process is a ‘black box’: Little is known about the reliability of the digital profiles that are created, or of the audience identification provided by buying platforms. In this paper, we investigate the performance of this audience delivery process with a focus on two widely-used demographic attributes, age and gender. We demonstrate in three field tests that digital profiles for these two attributes are often inaccurate across leading data brokers. For example, we show that digital profiling is often only able to accurately identify a male consumer around 50 percent of the time. We further find that accuracy of both digital profiling and audience delivery vary by provider and user characteristic - for example, the demographic characteristics of younger people or those who live in smaller households are easier to predict. Our findings suggest that third-party digital profiles currently result in a poor cost- benefit ratio for advertisers. We estimate that this leads to nearly $7bn of global ad spend wastage. Our results suggest that more verification, standards and transparency are required to avoid misclassifications and its potential negative consequences.},

   abstract = {Around the world, people increasingly generate data through their everyday activities. Much of this happens unwittingly through sensors, cameras, and other surveillance tools on roads, in cities, and at the workplace. However, how individuals and governments think about privacy varies significantly around the world. In this article, we explore differences between people’s attitudes toward privacy and data collection practices in the United States and the Netherlands, two countries with very different regulatory approaches to governing consumer privacy. Through a factorial vignette survey deployed in the two countries, we identify specific contextual factors associated with concerns regarding how personal data are being used. Using Nissenbaum’s framework of privacy as contextual integrity to guide our analysis, we consider the role that five factors play in this assessment: actors (those using data), data type, amount of data collected, reported purpose of data use, and inferences drawn from the data. Findings indicate nationally bound differences as well as shared concerns and indicate future directions for cross-cultural privacy research.},

The tbDEX protocol facilitates decentralized networks of exchange between assets by providing a framework for establishing social trust, utilizing decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to establish the provenance of identity in the real world. The protocol has no opinion on anonymity as a feature or consequence of transactions. Instead, it allows willing counterparties to negotiate and establish the minimum information acceptable for the exchange. Moreover, it provides the infrastructure necessary to create a ubiquity of on-ramps and off-ramps directly between the fiat and crypto financial systems without the need for centralized intermediaries and trust brokers. This makes crypto assets and decentralized financial services more accessible to everyone.},
